Janille Rose Olegario -
Front End Assessment

This project is for an assessment for MindArc.

You will see here exercise 1 and 2. 
I added a data on daja.json and another tab for my answer about banana.

I wasn't able to finish accordion because I saw my email late and started late and i'm still trying to submit my assessment on time.

I created a new branch name called develop for this assessment.

Fetch data on data.json using jQuery.

Built this project with:
HTML,
